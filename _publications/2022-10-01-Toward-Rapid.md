excerpt: 'The decision and control problem for swarm operations is crucial for autonomous management of military conflict. In this paper, we prove that the underlying decision and control problem can be treated as a noncooperative game problem, and then proceed to introduce a parallelized algorithm to seek the desired Nash equilibrium with the help of the maximum weight matching algorithm. The proposed scheme is proved to be optimal with a guaranteed -Nash solution and rapid computational speed. '

The decision and control problem for swarm operations is crucial for autonomous management of military conflict. In this paper, we prove that the underlying decision and control problem can be treated as a noncooperative game problem, and then proceed to introduce a parallelized algorithm to seek the desired Nash equilibrium with the help of the maximum weight matching algorithm. The proposed scheme is proved to be optimal with a guaranteed -Nash solution and rapid computational speed.
