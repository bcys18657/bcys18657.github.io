As is well known, military operation in a combat scenario is extremely intricate and often prone to optimal and real-time decisions. In this paper, we study task management and control problem for military operations with a dynamic game strategy. Toward this, the underlying problem is modeled by a matrix game scheme with performance index defined for both parties. Then, we proceed to present a fast and optimal search algorithm, inspired by graph theory and Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, to solve dimension explosion problem inherent with matrix game scheme and retrieve the optimal solution for each combat entity. Simulation results verified the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
