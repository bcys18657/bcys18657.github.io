I am a master student in the College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Chaoyong Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chaoyong). I am affiliated with Skywalker Laboratory.

In general, my entire research experience is **<font size=4 color=red>BASICS</font>** - **<font color=red>B</font>**ased on **<font color=red>A</font>**utonomous **<font color=red>S</font>**warm **<font color=red>I</font>**ntelligent **<font color=red>C</font>**ontrol **<font color=red>S</font>**ystems. More specifically, I am fascinated with the control scheme for large-scale swarm systems, which involves various research areas, including dynamic game theory, optimal control, and graph theory. I focus on the decision-making process of swarm systems in complex dynamic environments.
