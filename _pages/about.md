I am a master student in the College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Chaoyong Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chaoyong). I am affiliated with Skywalker Laboratory.

In general, my entire research experience is **<font size=4>BASICS</font>** - <font color=#FF000>B</font>ased on <font size=4>A</font>utonomous <font color=#FF000 size=4>S</font>warm <font color=#FF000 size=4>I</font>ntelligent <font color=#FF000 size=4>C</font>ontrol <font color=#FF000 size=4>S</font>ystems. More specifically, I am fascinated with the control scheme for large-scale swarm systems, which involves various research areas, including dynamic game theory, optimal control, and graph theory. I focus on the decision-making process of swarm systems in complex dynamic environments.
