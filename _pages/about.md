My Chinese name is 张涛 (pronounced 'Zhang Tao'). I am now pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/) at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. I am affiliated with Centre for Intelligent Machines (CIM) at ECE. My Ph.D. supervisors are [Prof. Peter E. Caines](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~peterc/) and [Prof. Aditya Mahajan](https://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~amahaj1/). Before that, I received the M.Eng degree in electrical engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2023, advised by [Prof. Chaoyong Li](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chaoyong). Before that, I received my bachelor degree in Automation from Zhejiang University.

About My Work

In general, my entire research experience is **<font size=4 color=red>BASICS</font>** - **<font color=red>B</font>**ased on **<font color=red>A</font>**utonomous **<font color=red>S</font>**warm **<font color=red>I</font>**ntelligent **<font color=red>C</font>**ontrol **<font color=red>S</font>**ystems. More specifically, I am fascinated with the control scheme for large-scale swarm systems, which involves various research areas, including dynamic game theory, stochastic control, and graph theory. I focus on the decision-making process of swarm systems in complex dynamic environments. In addition, I also have a deep interest in many other research areas on intelligent systems.
