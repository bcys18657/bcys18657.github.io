**My Name**

My last name is Zhang (张), one of the oldest Chinese surnames. My first name is Tao (涛), meaning 'tide' in English. So my English name is Ted.

**Growth Experience**

* I'm born in Sui County, Henan Province.
* My father is a high school history teacher, so I also have great interest in history, especially Chinese history.
* My father is also a calligrapher and writes a beautiful hand. I admire him but, unfortunately, my handwriting is ugly.
* My mother graduated from high school but was unable to continue her education in college due to poverty. But she is very smart and has a strong memory.
* I have a younger brother who is smarter than me and also an undergraduate at Zhejiang University.
* I have a beautiful girlfriend, and we have been classmates since high school.

**Learning Experience**

* I was enrolled in Zhejiang University through College Entrance Examination in 2016. I competed with nearly 1 million candidates and ranked top 0.05%.
* I majored in Civil Engineering in my first college year and transferred to Automation due to my lack of interest in Civil Engineering. I never regret that.
* I've built a self-balance robot – Cubli, the representative work in my undergraduate, which could maintain balance on its edge.
